== Description

Human Query Language for full text search engines. Provides a lenient
parser and associated tools for a self-contained and search-engine
agnostic query language suitable for use by end users. Lenient in that
is will produce a parse tree for any input, given a default operator
and by generally ignoring any unparsable syntax. Suitable for use by
end users in that it supports potentially several operator variants
and a query language not unlike some major web search and other
commercial search engines.

The query language supports the following features at a high level:

* Boolean operators: AND (infix), OR (infix), NOT (prefix) with an
  implied default operator and precedence rules,
  e.g. "boy or girl -infant"

* Optional parenthesis for explicitly denoting precedence.

* Quoted phrases (for proximity matching)

* Declarable prefix scopes, e.g. "TITLE:(car or bike)"

The main components are each highly customizable:

HumanQL::QueryParser — Parses any arbitrary input string and outputs an
Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)

HumanQL::TreeNormalizer — Normalizes and imposes limits on an AST,
e.g. avoids pathological queries.

HumanQL::QueryGenerator — Given an AST, generates a Human Query
Language string.

HumanQL::PostgreSQLGenerator — Given an AST, generate strings suitable
for passing to PostgreSQL's to_tsquery function.

Other generators are possible.
